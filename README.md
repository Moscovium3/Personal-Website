Project Name: [Zhengying SUN personal website]
Overview
Welcome to the repository for [Your Project's Name]! This project is all about creating a personal/portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. The aim is to provide a comprehensive view of my professional persona, highlighting my experiences, achievements, and interests.

This website serves as a dynamic platform to not only display my work but also to share my thoughts on technology, programming, and any other areas I'm passionate about. It's a great way for potential employers, collaborators, and peers to learn more about me and get in touch.

Technology Stack
The website is developed using a combination of modern and efficient technologies, ensuring a robust and responsive user experience. Here's what I've used:

HTML5: For structuring the content of the website.
CSS3: For styling and visually presenting the HTML content. I've also used CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap/Flexbox/Grid CSS/etc.] for a responsive design.
JavaScript: To make the website interactive. [Include any specific libraries or frameworks used, e.g., React, jQuery].
GitHub Pages: For hosting the website, leveraging GitHub's seamless integration and deployment capabilities.
Thank you for visiting my project repository. Feel free to explore the code, and any suggestions or contributions are more than welcome!
